//Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
//DEFINITION Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeâ€™s next pointer points to an earlier node, 
//so as to make a loop in the linked list. EXAMPLE
//input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
//output: C
