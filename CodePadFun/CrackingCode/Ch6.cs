//You are trying to cook an egg for exactly fifteen minutes, 
//but instead of a timer, you are given two ropes which burn 
//for exactly 1 hour each. The ropes, however, are of uneven densities - i.e., 
//half the rope length-wise might take only two minutes to burn.
// 2 ropes 1 for an hour
// 15 mins = a
1 hr = 4a 
2 hr = 8a

//6.1 Add arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide) to make the
//following expression true: 3 1 3 6 = 8. You can use any parentheses you’d like.
+ - * /  ()
(3 + 1) / 3 * 6 = 8

//6.2 There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off.
Classic cheese board problem.

//6.3 You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, 
//and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
5 3 
4
3 jug + 3 jug -> 5 jug
Left 1 in 3 jug
Empty 5 jug
Put 1/3 jug 5 and put another full 3 jug to 5 jug.
Mission complished

//6.4 remove hat problem
Therefore, we have met the principles of induction. We have proven that it will take c nights to remove c hats.

//6.5 There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above it will break.
//If it’s dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. 
//Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.
 y = 100 / x + x
 xy = 100 + x2
 x2 - xy + 100 = 0
 10 -> 10 + 9 = 19
 11 -> 9 + 10 = 19
 12 -> 9 + 11 = 20
 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2

//6.6 Toggle box
1 -> open 
2 -> close
3 -> toggle
Actually it's a good the one
For observation.
All number has squre root.
